# Course Overview

## Welcome!

We have developed this course to give you an overview of the most common coding
concepts in Python such as data types, variables, operators, user interaction,
conditionals, and more! A programming language is significantly less complex
than human languages. And the best part is that they share several common
concepts.

## What is a Programming?

Computers are incredible machines capable of performing calculations much faster
than any human can ever perform. Unfortunately, they can’t come up with ideas
about what calculations to perform. A computer can only do what we tell it to
do. If we tell a computer to delete all of its files, it will gladly do it
without any thought.

Programming is the process of writing instructions for the computer. A
programmer has to analyze problems, design solutions, assess them, and then
write the instructions to implement a solution.

## Which Language Should I Use?

As mentioned earlier, programming languages share lots of similar concepts. Once
you’ve learned a language, you will be able to leverage the knowledge to learn
other languages much more quickly than you did your first one!

We will be using Python for this course for a few reasons:

- Reads almost like plain English.
- Environment set up is simpler.
- One of the most popular languages in the world
  ([StackOverflow Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof)).
- It’s used across several disciplines (scripting, machine learning, scientific
  computing, data science, web development, and automation).
- Has an incredibly supportive community
